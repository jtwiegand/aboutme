        <h5>Brief description of why I want to program.</h5>
        <p>I've always been a gamer since I was about 12, my plan is to learn basic web development and then branch out into game deveopment.  I started with Warcraft II back when it was a strategy game.  I also dabbled in MUDS (multi-user dimension) games.  These are text based games played through a basic HTML client.  I first learned basic scripting there, although I didn't consider that programming at the time.  I still play the occasional MMO, FPS, or strategy game.  I'm also married. My wife is finishing up her Masters at UNM, she will graduate at the end of this semester.  We plan to stay here in Albuquerque for the forseeable future.</p>
